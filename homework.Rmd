This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/Software-bootcamp/data/")
data.in <- read.delim("data.csv", header = TRUE)
data.albania <- subset(data.in, country=="Albania")
data.greece <- subset(data.in, country=="Greece")
data.belgium <- subset(data.in, country=="Belgium")
albania.x <- data.albania[,2]
greece.x <- data.greece[,2]
belgium.x <- data.belgium[,2]
albania.y <- data.albania[,6]
greece.y <- data.greece[,6]
belgium.y <- data.belgium[,6]
plot(albania.x, albania.y, main="Albania", xlab="YEAR", ylab="GDP") 
plot(greece.x, greece.y, main="Greece", xlab="YEAR", ylab="GDP") 
plot(belgium.x, belgium.y, main="Belgium", xlab="YEAR", ylab="GDP") 

```

Belgium has the highest rate of GDP per capital as compared to Alabania and Greece. These plots were prepared using R. Greece and Albania also had a increase in thse years.

```{r}
#data.continent <- unique(data.in[4])
#print(data.continent)
continentmean <- aggregate(data.in[5], by=data.in[4], mean)
continentmin <- aggregate(data.in[5], by=data.in[4], min)
continentmax <- aggregate(data.in[5], by=data.in[4], max)
print("The mean of life expectancy in each continent is:")
print(continentmean)
print("The minimum life expectancy in each continent is:")
print(continentmin)
print("The maximum life expectancy in each continent is:")
print(continentmax)
```

Oceania has the highest and Africa has the lowest mean life expectancy among all the six continents.
Overall Oceania is the best continent to live.

```{r}

```
